## 2/2/2026 5:51 PM - The birth of the project  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I was thinking about how I could improve my **smart home** and it occurred to me that I could create a **box** that I could control e.g. lights, Spotify, Netflix,...
So I thought that if I put together a small **ESP32-C3** and other things, I could create a portable **box** that would have a built-in **battery**!
I continued and started looking for what I had at home... I only found an **OLED** **display** and nothing else, so I had to go to the **internet**, where I found all the things!

## 2/2/2026 5:55 PM - The beginning of 3D modeling  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

When I had it **ready**, I prepared all the things and started looking for their **sizes** etc. It went well at first and then it got even better.
Then I went to **TinkerCad** where I decided to model the case and I started! I immediately created the walls and then made holes for the buttons, **OLED** **display**,...

## 2/2/2026 5:58 PM - Continuation and a minor mistake...  

_Time spent: 1.1h_  

Right after finishing the main parts, I started making the holder for the **charging** **module**, the hole for the rings, the lid or even the **rings** themselves (_so that I would know where each button was later_)!
It went pretty quickly, but I had a **small problem**... If I wanted to put a battery in there, I made a case that was too **small** - so I took everything apart again and made smaller walls and enlarged the **hole** for the components.

## 2/2/2026 7:02 PM - Wiring diagram  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

When I had the **3D models** ready, I moved on again! I went to make a **wiring diagram** so that everything could be seen **clearly**...
First I looked for all the components, but for example the **charging** **module** was missing, so we had to create it, add **pins** to it,...
It was fast and in about an hour with a few **mistakes** I had it finished.

## 2/2/2026 7:50 PM - Codinggggg  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

I threw myself into writing code but I had one big **PROBLEM**! I had to figure out how to wirelessly connect Google Home to **ESP32**...
I did some research and found _Sinric.pro_, which should work great for my **project**.
It can turn things on and off, it can also trigger **routines**, etc. So I started writing and defined my **code**:

- 1. = **Monitor strip**
- 2. = **Plug**
- 3. = **Xbox**
- 4. = **Spotify routine**

## 2/2/2026 8 PM - BOM and GitHub editing  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

When I had some **free** time, I started creating BOM and other things for **GitHub**!
I had to find exactly the things for my **project** and I did it... I also created a **REPO** and converted the **.****STL** files to **.STEP**.
